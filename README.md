# Support-Vector-Machines

## SVM Assignment 

In this problem, we will apply a support vector machine to classify hand-written digits. You do not have to implement the SVM algorithm: `scikit-learn` has built-in classes for you to utilize. 

 The file `uspsdata.txt` contains a matrix with one data point (= vector of length 256) per row.

The 256-vector in each row represents a 16 × 16 image of a handwritten number. The file `uspscl.txt` contains the corresponding class labels. The data contains two classes—the digits 5 and 6—so the class labels are stored as -1 and +1, respectively. The image on the right shows the first row, re-arranged as a 16 × 16 matrix and plotted as a gray scale image.
